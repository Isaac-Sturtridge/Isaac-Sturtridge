### Welcome to my page
I got into development while working in China. I was inspired by the possibility that with the right tools, I could create anything in a digital landscape. I love learning and reading documentation on new languages, and I've learned and built projects in JavaScript, Python and Ruby. Check out my public repositories to see what I've built. Recently I've done the Northcoders bootcamp, which taught me full-stack capabilities, and my pinned projects show some of the great things I've made. I've made a fantastic full-stack game with websockets, and I've made a news app that flawlessly allows users to add comments to articles and have them appear in a persistent database. I want to continue producing little tools to be used around the web so I can try out more technologies.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a music teaching app!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# and Flask. I'm using Microsoft's Learning Environment to learn C# and I'm trying out backend apps with Flask.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects to improve my skills, hit me up if you see something you think I can find useful.
