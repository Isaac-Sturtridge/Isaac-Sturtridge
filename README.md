### Welcome to my page
I got into development while working in China. I was inspired by the possibility that with the right tools, I could create anything in a digital landscape. I love learning and reading documentation on new languages, and I've learned and built projects in JavaScript, Python and Ruby. Check out my public repositories to see what I've built. I have full-stack capabilities, and my pinned projects show some of the great things I've made. I've made a fantastic full-stack game with websockets, and I've made a news app that flawlessly allows users to add comments to articles and have them appear in a persistent database. I want to continue producing little tools to be used around the web so I can try out more technologies.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently operating on testing with my company.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# to add to my expertise.
- ðŸ‘¯ I am open to ideas for colaboration.
