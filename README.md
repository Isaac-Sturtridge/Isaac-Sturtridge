### Welcome to my page
I got into development in 2021. I was inspired by the possibility that with the right tools, I could create anything in a digital landscape. I love learning and reading documentation on new languages, and I've learned and built projects in JavaScript, Python, C# and Ruby. Check out my public repositories to see what I've built. I have full-stack capabilities, and my pinned projects show some of the great things I've made. I've made a full-stack game with websockets, a specialised calculator for defining bowling teams, and a news app that flawlessly allows users to add comments to articles and have them appear in a persistent database. I want to continue learning and building as I experience software development and related disciplines in my current role.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working with a team that uses TypeScript and learning it.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve spent the past few months working on a test automation project written in C# .NET, using Selenium.
- ðŸ‘¯ I am open to ideas for collaboration.
